              Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is a rocky planet, the
              second most massive and second largest of the Solar System,
              narrowly second to Earth, and it has an atmosphere, which is the
              thickest of all four rocky planets of the Solar System, being
              substantially thicker than Earth's. Its orbit is the next closest
              to Earth's, orbiting the Sun inside of Earth's orbit, making it an
              inferior planet of Earth, appearing in Earth's sky always close to
              the Sun in inferior position and subsequently (like Mercury) as
              either "morning star" or "evening star". Furthermore Venus is the
              natural object in Earth's sky with the third highest maximum
              apparent brightness, after the Sun and the Moon, due to its
              proximity to Earth and the Sun, its size and it's atmosphere

              Mars is the fourth planet and the furthest terrestrial planet from

              the finely-grained iron(III) oxide dust in the soil, which give
              rise to its nickname, "the Red Planet". There is a drastic
              contrast between the two Martian hemispheres: the northern
              hemisphere is on average flatter and smoother than the southern
              hemisphere. The planet's two poles are covered by water and carbon
              dioxide ice caps. Surrounding the Martian surface is a dynamic
              thin atmosphere (1% of Earth's surface pressure), made primarily
              of carbon dioxide. Mars has two irregularly shaped natural
              satellites, Phobos and Deimos.

              methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which in astronomy is

              has a marked axial tilt of 97.8° with a retrograde rotation rate
              of 17 hours. This means that in an 84 Earth years orbital period
              around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous

              Neptune is the eighth planet from the Sun and the farthest known
              planet in the Solar System. It is the fourth-largest planet in the
              Solar System by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and the
              densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of Earth, and
              slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser
              and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes
              more gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Being composed
              primarily of gases and liquids, it has no well-defined solid
              surface. The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an
              average distance of 30.1 astronomical units (4.5 billion
              kilometres; 2.8 billion miles). It is named after the Roman god of
              the sea and has the astronomical symbol ♆, representing Neptune's
